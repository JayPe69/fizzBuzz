# Pre requisite
 - NodeJS
 - Typescript

# How to execute

 1. Git clone the project
 2. Execute the following command line

```bash
npx ts-node main.ts
```

# Display values from different numbers

The fizzBuzz function takes 2 number parameters.  
So if you need to execute it for numbers that are not 1 and 100, then you just need to change it in the main.ts

For example :   
 > fizzBuzz(100,200)
